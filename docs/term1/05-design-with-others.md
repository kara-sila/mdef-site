## Day 1: Non-Subordinate AI
To interrupt habitual human-centered thinking and clear conceptual space
for imagining AI as an autonomous, non-subordinate intelligence.

While thinking about a support structure for a non-subordinate AI, we didn't want to create a more efficient or optimized version of it. But rather, we wanted to find a way to set it free and autonomous. In order to achieve this we tried to make AI "trip", eventhough most structures prohibit to hallucinate. Thus, to support our non-autonomous AI, we used magic chocolate.
