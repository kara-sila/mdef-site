# Unpcking Tech Systems

## The Reflection

By the end of the course, my perpective towards an object shifted from just seing the exterior to understanding the guts of the object. During the course, i realized how possible it is to understand and change an object. Ofcourse there are a lot of things i did not know and got help from the Fab Lab. However, the main key takeaway for me is not learning how to hack the radio, it was **learning how to learn and the open-source ecosystem**. I find myself looking at machines from a critical perspective.

I don't approach machines primarily in terms of efficiency or optimization. Instead, I see them as sites for inquiry. Through forensic analysis, misuse, and speculative reconfiguration, technology became a medium for critique rather than a goal in itself.

By dismantling the radio and creating the forensic report we dig deep into how this machine was built, where it was built, the materials of different parts and traced the thought process of how it was created in the first place. 

By hacking different parts of the radio, I realized how much of a creative act hacking is! Although what we did and what we tried to understand is technical, each step and thinking behind hack was a speculative process. Figuring out everything from open-source documents and by trial and error was both frustrating and rewarding at the end. Even though we couldn't create a working useless machine at the end, I can clearly see how we can solve the problems we had, and how to find solutions. Hacking is just like designing, and none of them have a linear process. 

I learned a lot, by failing a lot.

### The Zine

This zine is also created from an obsolete paper, without using any technology whatsoever other than pens (not even scissors).
