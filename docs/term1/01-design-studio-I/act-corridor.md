# Act I: Metro Corridor

## Conceptual Framework
This project explores how an intimate and partner-based movemement danced by two women can temporarily reorganize the behavioral and spatial norms of a narrow underground corridor. This location is selected for its physical and social conditions; long, poorly ventilated and continuously filled with random commuters. In this environments it is expected to follow linear trajectories, avoid contact, and prioritize efficiency over presense. By inserting a slow and responsive dance into this space, the intervention tests how the existing flow of public transit can be disrupted without blocking it. The act is not a performance staged for and audience; but a momentary reconfiguration of an everyday flow. The dancers’ presence introduces a non-functional movement that contrasts with the corridors utilitarian logic.

The act creates a temporary autonomous zone within a highly regulated environment. This temporary zone emerges through the embodied action where normative behaviors are suspended or replaced with proximity, attention and co-presence. The act is neither a performance for spectators nor an attempt to disrupt transportation. This framework positions the intervention as a method for observing how commuters negotiate, resist, ignore or absorb this autonomous zone and how dancers manage vulnerability within an unchosen audience. It focuses on how such an ephemeral intervention reveals the tensions between individual movement and the way the infrastructure dictates behavior.
