# Prototypes

## Prototype 1: The Internal Stop Sign
→ embodied self prototype
→ internalized control, hesitation, self-surveillance

### Description
Before entering public space, I create a series of short, private movement tests where I intentionally begin to move (sway, shift weight, mark steps) and then stop yourself the moment discomfort or self-judgment arises. Each stop is noted: where it happens in the body, what thought triggers it, and how quickly control intervenes.

### Relevance
This prototype isolates self-surveillance before external surveillance appears. It helps me to identify which movements feel *forbidden* even without witnesses.

### Outcome
A personal “map of inhibition” that shows how far the public acts should push discomfort without tipping into paralysis.


## Protoype 2: Spatial Threshold Mapping
→ site-based speculative test
→ how different public spaces tolerate deviation

### Description
I visited multiple public spaces (metro hallways, shopping streets, plazas) and perform minimal, almost invisible deviations from normative movement: slowing down drastically, standing in partner proximity without touching, or walking in mirrored steps. No full dance yet—only gestures that hover at the edge of acceptability.

### Relevance
This prototype identifies spatial thresholds: how much non-normative movement a space can absorb before reactions occur.

### Outcome
A comparative understanding of which spaces invite avoidance, curiosity, intervention, or indifference—directly informing site selection for the acts.

## Prototype 3: The Unclaimed Dance Frame
→ social perception prototype
→ audience expectations and categorizations

### Description
Me and a partner enter public space dressed neutrally and take a tango hold without music, signage, or performance cues. You remain still for several minutes, holding the posture, then dissolve it without explanation.

### Relevance
This prototype tests what happens when dance-like position can be percieved but not activated, and when the public cannot easily label the action as performance, protest, or entertainment.

### Outcome
Insights into how people project meaning, when documentation begins, and how ambiguity functions as a protective or disruptive strategy.
