# Prototypes

## Prototype 1: The Internal Stop Sign
-> embodied self prototype
-> internalized control, hesitation, self-surveillance

### Description
Before entering public space, I create a series of short, private movement tests where I intentionally begin to move (sway, shift weight, mark steps) and then stop yourself the moment discomfort or self-judgment arises. Each stop is noted: where it happens in the body, what thought triggers it, and how quickly control intervenes.

### Relevance
This prototype isolates self-surveillance before external surveillance appears. It helps me to identify which movements feel *forbidden* even without witnesses.

### Outcome
A personal “map of inhibition” that shows how far the public acts should push discomfort without tipping into paralysis.


## Protoype 2: Spatial Threshold Mapping
-> site-based speculative test
-> how different public spaces tolerate deviation

### Description
I visited multiple public spaces (metro hallways, shopping streets, plazas) and perform minimal, almost invisible deviations from normative movement: slowing down drastically, standing in partner proximity without touching, or walking in mirrored steps. No full dance yet—only gestures that hover at the edge of acceptability.
