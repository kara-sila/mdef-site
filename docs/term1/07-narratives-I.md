# Narrative I : Collective Publication

My proposal is to create a book which is created by other booklets. Each person will have a separate booklet of 2 papers (4 pages, that we can achieve by folding one piece of paper). The first page is the cover, second and third is the inside of the booklet and the fourth page is the end page. The first page can be a colored transparent sheet, a patterned translucent sheet or a piece of paper with a cut out; the purpose of the first page is to give a limited information, a trailer, of your your project where you can reflect your method or perspective briefly through a color, pattern or a cutout. After turning the first page readers will be able to see all the content (second and third pages) and the last page can be dedicated to the contact information and the references. These little bootlets should have connection points (hoops, perhaps?) where you can collect and combine them with a connector (carabiner?). This way, we can showcase/put these individual booklets at the end-of-year exhibition and we can have another master booklet explaining the exhibition with a connector. Visitors can collect the booklets they want and create their own exhibition book.
