# Unpacking Tech Systems

## Forensics of Obsolescence

In this course we approached machines not as neutral tools, but as artifacts embedded in systems of production, use, neglect, and abandonment. Through forensic analysis, dismantling, and speculative reconfiguration, we examined how everyday technologies fail, not necessarily because they stop functioning, but because they lose relevance within shifting socio-technical conditions.

The central question was not how to fix machines, but how to understand them; which part is used for which function, has it opened and hacked before, and how can we use its parts to create something without the limits of keeping everything functional, efective or useful.

### The Radio
The chosen object was a Sunstech Arch Audio RP-RD3000, a retro-style AM/FM radio designed for domestic use. At the time of examination, the device was somehow operational. Its status was not broken, but obsolete.

#### The Analysis
We conducted a full forensic teardown of the radio, treating it as evidence rather than equipment. The process included:
- External and internal disassembly
- Component cataloguing and documentation
- Material and manufacturing analysis
- Power and signal testing using lab equipment
- Functional tracing of signal flow and control logic

All components were laid out, identified, and documented individually to expose the internal logic of the machine.

The radio operates as a hybrid system:a nalog signal processing (AM/FM reception and demodulation), digital user interface (LCD display, button controls, presets), transformer-based power supply, internal passive speaker with amplification stage.
