# Unpacking Tech Systems

## Forensics of Obsolescence

In this course we approached machines not as neutral tools, but as artifacts embedded in systems of production, use, neglect, and abandonment. Through forensic analysis, dismantling, and speculative reconfiguration, we examined how everyday technologies fail, not necessarily because they stop functioning, but because they lose relevance within shifting socio-technical conditions.

The central question was not how to fix machines, but how to understand them; which part is used for which function, has it opened and hacked before, and how can we use its parts to create something without the limits of keeping everything functional, efective or useful.

### The Radio
The chosen object was a Sunstech Arch Audio RP-RD3000, a retro-style AM/FM radio designed for domestic use. At the time of examination, the device was somehow operational. Its status was not broken, but obsolete.
