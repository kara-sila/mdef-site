## The Detective Game

While I was the subject; i stayed in the class for couple minutes and then fleed! I had an eye on my back, giving the idea of my detective that I, myself, am not only the subject but also an observant of the detective. I run across the street and towards the beach, hoping to make my detective run with me. After I realized my detective was not with me and ran for around 5-10 minutes, I came back to the class.
