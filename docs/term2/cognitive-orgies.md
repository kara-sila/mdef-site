Exploring digital presence as a collective condition, using AI to reconfigure how bodies relate to space and to each other.

### Background
Armin and I worked on this project together. We mapped our areas of interests and came up with three main concepts; 
- dance, movement, motion
- alternative narratives
- driving human behavior

My research is on dance and movement in public spaces, and how it can create an alternative narrative for public spaces; while his is on how we extend our body/brain with technology, and with that how technology can drive our behavior. With these in mind we knew we wanted to focus on the intersection of movement and technology and came up with a shared research question;
**Can an alternative digital presense help people become more connected to their physical environment by movement?**

We had three ideas to work on. The first one was to use mapping, projecting interactive abstract surfaces; however, this required a portable projector which we didn't have (Referance: Refik Anadol). The second idea was to create an alternative visual of the space with the use of glasses, and this in the end is a highly individual experience (Referance: Google Lens). Although we were not pushing for a movement of multiple people, we wanted to create a space where this is possible. The final decision was to create a metronom-like device where we drive the movement with a phone and the metronom sound (which is kind of a ritual). 

### The Prototype
We worked on a metronom looking prototype to create a feeling of the metronom idea, where dancers, musicians and many professionals use for cues and to understand when to move. This was the core idea of our 3D shape, and we decided that the mechanism of a metronom was not needed but the visual representation was the important point. We tried early cardboard mock-ups, 3D prints with different materials.
