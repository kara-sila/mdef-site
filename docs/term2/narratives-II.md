# Narratives II

My proposal is to create a book which is created by other booklets. Each person will have a separate booklet of 2 papers (4 pages, that we can achieve by folding one piece of paper). The first page is the cover, second and third is the inside of the booklet and the fourth page is the end page. The first page can be a colored transparent sheet, a patterned translucent sheet or a piece of paper with a cut out; the purpose of the first page is to give a limited information, a trailer, of your your project where you can reflect your method or perspective briefly through a color, pattern or a cutout. After turning the first page readers will be able to see all the content (second and third pages) and the last page can be dedicated to the contact information and the references. These little bootlets should have connection points (hoops, perhaps?) where you can collect and combine them with a connector (carabiner?). This way, we can showcase/put these individual booklets at the end-of-year exhibition and we can have another master booklet explaining the exhibition with a connector. Visitors can collect the booklets they want and create their own exhibition book.

#### Notes: 
Whispers → Express yourself, extend your internal to the spaces that surround you with intentions of care and intimate relationships and agency.
Shouts → resist the capitalization of your private space and your most intimate rituals
**creating a home, healing**
- It refuses to be associated with a plain redecoration of home, or aesthetic reasons.
- My home, and belonging → priviledge
- Authority to speak about home
- Notion of living and feeling home → in its roots and from every aspect.
Collective → home needs something very different for everyone but i want to focus on a generation. for us it’s so different than our grandparents.


#### my lil poem:
 creating a home is an act of healing <br/>
 feels like a sweet summer breeze <br/>
 almost like a sense of hope <br/>
 to finally belong <br/>
