# Situated Design Practices

We saw and heard different perspectives, and different practices throughout this week. What stayed with me the most was our day at El Prat. That day didn't feel like a class. The question that was echoing in my head was "how can art can create communities?". Can a creative process make people become closer? I do feel like a community with my classmates after 5-6 months, community of MDEF. I believe every one of use need a community. We mostly don't recognize the importance of it in our daily lives but our communities define ourselves.

Does everyone has a community they can feel seen?

Also, the notion of private was one of the things that stayed and traveled with me. Especially the obsession for privacy in a post-private state, as Mercedes puts it. what is a post-private state? How other ways do we give consent in our daily lives? 
When it comes to sex, dungeons and power-play it becomes essential to get consent even both written and vocal. Everything becomes more sensitive and we feel like we should bee more diligent. Why don’t we follow a similar practice in our daily lives? Why the sensitivity only becomes visible when people are vulnerable? Is it because of a form of fear? What other ways we show our sensibility and vulnerability?
