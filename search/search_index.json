The chosen site directly in front of the Uniqlo store on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia\u2014operates as a corridor of consumption, photography, and spectacle. In this environment, bodies are expected to circulate smoothly, observe passively, and engage primarily as consumers. Public movement is shaped by branding, storefront displays, and the constant presence of people documenting their surroundings. By introducing a slow, relational tango into this setting, the intervention tests how the dominant rhythms of tourism can be subtly disrupted without obstructing pedestrian flow. The act is not framed as entertainment for passersby but as an alternative form of presence inserted into a space where performances are typically commercialized or curated. The dancers\u2019 gesture introduces a non-transactional, non-commodified action that contrasts with the commercial logic of the boulevard. The act generates a temporary autonomous zone within a space governed by consumption, surveillance, and constant visual capture. This temporary zone appears through embodied action: normative tourist behaviors like photographing, browsing, rushing that are interrupted or renegotiated in the presence of a movement that does not seek their attention. The act is neither a street performance nor a promotional gesture; rather, it becomes a method for observing how tourists respond to an encounter that sits outside their expectations of entertainment or attraction. This framework focuses on how different forms of spectatorship emerge: who stops, who records, who ignores, and who reroutes.

Timing \u00b6 Choose two different time slots: midday (high tourist activity) and early evening (transition between commuters and tourists). Observe for 5\u201310 minutes before starting: note crowd density, security presence, and performer safety. Preperation \u00b6 Agree with your dance partner on: the duration of the dance (3\u20137 minutes per activation) which tango pattern to use (slow, grounded, minimal steps) how to enter and exit the space Decide in advance how to signal discomfort, interruption, or the need to stop. Activation \u00b6 Enter the space casually, without theatrics. Begin dancing immediately, maintaining slow tempo, compact frame, non-performative movement. Avoid facing the public intentionally; keep the dance self-contained. Observation \u00b6 Observe from the documentation: how tourists react (stop, record, ignore, reroute, stare) whether storefront staff or security respond how pedestrian flow shifts how your own body reacts to visibility, attention, or discomfort Documentation \u00b6 Use a small phone camera placed discretely nearby or have a friend record from a distance.

Rather than positioning critique through language, representation, or spectacle, this project locates critique in embodied action: in hesitation, rhythm, proximity, discomfort, and presence. Even though my project started off as a movement exploration, it quickly shifted to public movement. The project emerges from my lived experience of navigating public space as a gendered body shaped by social expectations of control, productivity, and visibility. From an early age, movement has been regulated where, how, and when it is acceptable to move. Dance is often permitted only within designated spaces or when framed as performance, fitness, or content. Outside of these frames, spontaneous movement becomes suspicious, shameful, or inappropriate. This project begins from that friction. Manifesto \u00b6 I have joined dance classes, meet-ups, and movement gatherings where we learned new choreographies, techniques, or simply moved through improvisation. Each gathering carries its own agenda and boundaries, even when it is improvisation. Except for those moments when we just hear music and instinctively accompany its rhythm. Each time, I feel the same uncomfortable feeling where everything I learned so far tells me to stop but I simply feel that I want to follow the rhythm. These learnings are deeply embodied, passed down from society: we learned that good girls don\u2019t dance in public, they jog for productivity, stretch for posture, and sway only when no one\u2019s watching; we learned how to act to be accepted. We\u2019ve been told to sit still, behave, and smile politely while the world burns out our nervous systems. Every moment I\u2019ve ignored my impulse to move has made me feel controlled. That same sense of control seeps into other parts of my life, unnoticed but persistent. Yet, every time I let go allowing movement to guide me, I feel both shame and unexpected relief. A release that remains, shaping the rest of my day, until I ignore it again. My auto-ethnographic exploration of movement in public spaces emerges from the tension between inner rhythm and societal tempo. I observe my body as both subject and tool\u2014understanding how motion regulates my stress, how visibility triggers shame, and how the act of moving publicly becomes an act of reclaiming presence. Public movement is only glorified when it\u2019s filmed and put on social media, movement becomes Instagrammable in the eyes of watchers. Public movement is an act of vulnerability, it\u2019s shameful, powerful, terrifying, uncomfortable, and necessary . In an environment that values speed and productivity over well-being, movement as reflection without purpose becomes rebellion . We feel caged because we live by rules that were taught, not chosen. I believe the body remembers what the mind forgets, and the body knows when the mind is lost in a 9 to 5 trance. I refuse to move only when the world allows it. I will dance because I feel like it and because I am tired of being still. I invite you to; slow down listen to your body notice the world around you notice the rhythm of your environment rather than the voices telling you to stop. dance like nobody\u2019s monetizing it. I invite you to feel uncomfortable, and ashamed. Use dance as a method, a meditation, and a manifesto. Each one of us is a dancer. There is no hierarchy of movement and nothing is unimportant. Resistance exists only with struggle. Movement must be an attack on the accepted learnings. Stress is not a badge of honor, it\u2019s a symptom of control. Auto-Etnographic Research \u00b6 Embodied Criticism is grounded in my auto-ethnographic research. I use my own body as both subject and research instrument, observing how movement regulates stress, how visibility triggers self-surveillance, and how public space conditions behavior. Throughout the process, i moved, jumped, danced in various places; my home, in the park, in school, in the mountains, with friends and alone. The research unfolds through repeated movement, reflections, documentation, and analysis on my shame and heartbeat. My main focus was not only on external reactions, but to internal states: hesitation, grounding, fear, pleasure, shame, relief. Movement becomes a method for sensing how power operates through infrastructure, social norms, and unspoken expectations. Public movement, in this context, is not entertainment. It is a form of inquiry. A way to test how bodies are allowed to exist\u2014and how they might exist otherwise.

Through forensic analysis, dismantling, and speculative reconfiguration, we examined how everyday technologies fail, not necessarily because they stop functioning, but because they lose relevance within shifting socio-technical conditions. The central question was not how to fix machines, but how to understand them; which part is used for which function, has it opened and hacked before, and how can we use its parts to create something without the limits of keeping everything functional, efective or useful. The Radio \u00b6 The chosen object was a Sunstech Arch Audio RP-RD3000, a retro-style AM/FM radio designed for domestic use. At the time of examination, the device was somehow operational. Its status was not broken, but obsolete. The Analysis \u00b6 We conducted a full forensic teardown of the radio, treating it as evidence rather than equipment. The process included: - External and internal disassembly - Component cataloguing and documentation - Material and manufacturing analysis - Power and signal testing using lab equipment - Functional tracing of signal flow and control logic All components were laid out, identified, and documented individually to expose the internal logic of the machine. We also recorded every step of the process to make sure that we would be able to reconstruct everything back.

Through forensic analysis, dismantling, and speculative reconfiguration, we examined how everyday technologies fail, not necessarily because they stop functioning, but because they lose relevance within shifting socio-technical conditions. The central question was not how to fix machines, but how to understand them; which part is used for which function, has it opened and hacked before, and how can we use its parts to create something without the limits of keeping everything functional, efective or useful.","title":"Forensics of Obsolescence"},{"location":"term1/04-unpacking-tech-systems/forensics/#the-radio","text":"The chosen object was a Sunstech Arch Audio RP-RD3000, a retro-style AM/FM radio designed for domestic use. At the time of examination, the device was somehow operational. Its status was not broken, but obsolete.","title":"The Radio"},{"location":"term1/04-unpacking-tech-systems/forensics/#the-analysis","text":"We conducted a full forensic teardown of the radio, treating it as evidence rather than equipment. The process included: - External and internal disassembly - Component cataloguing and documentation - Material and manufacturing analysis - Power and signal testing using lab equipment - Functional tracing of signal flow and control logic All components were laid out, identified, and documented individually to expose the internal logic of the machine. We also recorded every step of the process to make sure that we would be able to reconstruct everything back.
