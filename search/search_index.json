What I have not considered so far was the other possible limb we might create for ourselves. From this perspective, we can alter our own senses and bodies according to our wants and needs. Thinking from this point of view, this is not a far idea, we already alter our bodies with tattoos, jeweleries, clothes. Our phones already became a limb for most of us!

When we read about technological advancements, having a high-tech device; we are mostly thinking about taking a relatively better photos or doing a daily chore easier. What we don\u2019t really consider is what we actually want to do with technology and how we can achieve that.

Played and experimented with Barduino, inputs & outputs, laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC milling, casting and molding, biomaterials and touch designer! My background in design made me already interacted with some of the technologies such as laser cutting and 3D printing however other technologies were the first time i have got the chance to work with. This is a quick reflection of what i have learned, but first the most important take away from the course; measure twice, cut once. Inputs & Outputs \u00b6 In the pre-courses we have already worked with FabLab to unlock basic electronics understandings and built quick prototypes. This course was a brief repeat to remember what we\u2019ve learned throughout the pre-course. I worked on my project where i tried to combine barduino and a LED strip; when the touch sensor senses a proximity LEDs turns from cold colors (blue, green) to warm colors (red, orange). If there\u2019s a touch, the buzzer on the bardunio creates a sound (and buzz). Although i couldn\u2019t achieve this outcome fully, i experimented with the combination of different elements and figuring out the code. Laser Cutting \u00b6 Laser Cutting course had several steps where we prepared our rhino files and send them to cut. We used a premade rhino file of 2D shapes and added more details into the file. These details strated off as random shapes, then quickly turned into intentional decisions where we considered margins, layers, and the space between lines. Cutting the material first hand, and learning small but highly important points ,such as turning the ventilation before starting anything, were the key learning points for me. 3D Printing \u00b6 I used 3D printing technologies before (6 years ago), however; i haven\u2019t realized how much I forgot! This course was a valuable refresher for me to revisit my previous learnings and the machines we have at IAAC. My main take away was learning how to use bamboo lab, and the important details of the interface. For this course we printed a small maze, next i would like to try a more organic or non linear structure to test supports and smoothness of the layers. CNC Milling \u00b6 This was the first time i used CNC milling, and honestly the most scary one! We created a bed for our printed maze. While preparing the rhino file, we stumbled on several problems, and fails. Some really important points; - think about the technology you are using and design according to its limitations and possibilities, or pick another technology - consider the size of the bit and your working area, decide on the space between cutting lines accordingly - know your material and how it might behave during milling - always check the cutting depth and your bit (50% rule) to avoid damaging the machine This is the course i failed the most, and learned the most. Casting and Molding \u00b6 I have never worked with casting materials and had no prior knowledge about the ratios and materials. Therefore, this course was full of learning for me. We didn\u2019t realize that we would be using the box we made with laser cutting, so we were concered that the mold might not come out. We did the casting anyways and used oil to help removing part. In the end, it was came out smooth and even the small details were visible! Touch Designer \u00b6 Touch designer is a program that I\u2019ve been curious about. This course was a quick introduction of what we can achieve by using touch designer, how we can use in our projects and its possibilities in general. Also we made a basic animation for fundamentals of the program. I\u2019d like to experiment more to expand my knowledge and my toolset. Biomaterials \u00b6 In my projects, i mostly use metals or wood but never tried to create my own material! During this course i realized the potential of creating my own material to use and tailoring it to projects. We have used different recipes with wooden molds and also with the mold we made in the casting course! Our mold was soft and there was only one recipe that would be suitable for that (since the mold is soft, the material had to be hard). We initially thought that the biomaterial might not be able to come out because the material is not hard enough, however; after curing it shrinked a bit and was easy to take it out. At the end, the material was messy because of the additional coloring we added at the end. After this course I got more interested in the biomaterials and we did a little workshop with Agnes at the Valldaura Labs where we cooked different recipes, included some materials we collected (berries for color, acorns) and tried to do a bioprinting on a shirt.

This location is selected for its physical and social conditions; long, poorly ventilated and continuously filled with random commuters. In this environments it is expected to follow linear trajectories, avoid contact, and prioritize efficiency over presense. By inserting a slow and responsive dance into this space, the intervention tests how the existing flow of public transit can be disrupted without blocking it. The act is not a performance staged for and audience; but a momentary reconfiguration of an everyday flow. The dancers\u2019 presence introduces a non-functional movement that contrasts with the corridors utilitarian logic. The act creates a temporary autonomous zone within a highly regulated environment. This temporary zone emerges through the embodied action where normative behaviors are suspended or replaced with proximity, attention and co-presence. The act is neither a performance for spectators nor an attempt to disrupt transportation. This framework positions the intervention as a method for observing how commuters negotiate, resist, ignore or absorb this autonomous zone and how dancers manage vulnerability within an unchosen audience. It focuses on how such an ephemeral intervention reveals the tensions between individual movement and the way the infrastructure dictates behavior.

Document: Density of movement, Typical walking speeds, Commuter demographics, Security presence, Light, sound, temperature, airflow Internal Rehearsal \u00b6 Practice a compact tango walk suitable for limited space: Minimal steps, contained upper body, slow pivoting. Define the mode of interaction between dancers: Close embrace or open embrace, Tempo slow enough to not fully obstruct the corridor Agree on communication signals: Start/stop, Adjust proximity to commuters, Safety withdrawal Legal / Informal Boundary Check Confirm that no local laws strictly prohibit non-blocking movement-based activities in the metro (the intervention must remain non-obstructive). Set a contingency plan if approached by security: Maintain calm, Clarify the action as non-commercial, non-political, non-obstructive movement. Intervention Phase \u00b6 Choose a time when the corridor is busy enough for meaningful interaction but not dangerously overcrowded. Typically: 8:30\u201310:00 or 17:00\u201318:30. Duration: 5\u201310 minutes per cycle, 2\u20134 cycles spaced apart. Begin at the midpoint of the corridor. Stand parallel to the main flow, then gradually rotate into the dance frame. Maintain mobility never fully blocking the corridor. Start a slow tango walk with music from headphones (to avoid public amplification). Allow the dance to unfold as: A micro-slowdown in a high-velocity zone, A momentary pause in the logic of transit, A temporary alternative rhythm within the regulated space. This is where the Temporary Autonomous Zone emerges: A short-lived pocket of autonomy created not by permission, but by the softness, slowness, and non-functionality of the action. Documentation: A discreet third observer recording from the edge. Field notes from dancers and observers before and afterward. Documentation focus: Commuter reactions, Flow disruptions or detours, Moments of hesitation, curiosity, discomfort, or avoidance, How long the TAZ remains unchallenged. Controlled Exit \u00b6 Stop the dance gradually while still in motion (exiting through walking rather than pausing). Rejoin the commuter flow seamlessly. Within 15 minutes, write down or record: Sensations during the dance, Shifts in atmosphere, How the corridor \u201cheld\u201d or \u201cresisted\u201d the TAZ, Physical or emotional responses from others Optional Second Cycle Repeat at a different time later the same day or week to compare conditions.","title":"Act:Corridor"},{"location":"term1/01-design-studio-I/act-corridor/#act-i-metro-corridor","text":"","title":"Act I: Metro Corridor"},{"location":"term1/01-design-studio-I/act-corridor/#conceptual-framework","text":"This project explores how an intimate and partner-based movemement danced by two women can temporarily reorganize the behavioral and spatial norms of a narrow underground corridor.

The act generates a temporary autonomous zone within a space governed by consumption, surveillance, and constant visual capture. This temporary zone appears through embodied action: normative tourist behaviors like photographing, browsing, rushing that are interrupted or renegotiated in the presence of a movement that does not seek their attention. The act is neither a street performance nor a promotional gesture; rather, it becomes a method for observing how tourists respond to an encounter that sits outside their expectations of entertainment or attraction.

Rather than positioning critique through language, representation, or spectacle, this project locates critique in embodied action: in hesitation, rhythm, proximity, discomfort, and presence. Even though my project started off as a movement exploration, it quickly shifted to public movement. The project emerges from my lived experience of navigating public space as a gendered body shaped by social expectations of control, productivity, and visibility. From an early age, movement has been regulated where, how, and when it is acceptable to move. Dance is often permitted only within designated spaces or when framed as performance, fitness, or content. Outside of these frames, spontaneous movement becomes suspicious, shameful, or inappropriate. This project begins from that friction. Manifesto \u00b6 I have joined dance classes, meet-ups, and movement gatherings where we learned new choreographies, techniques, or simply moved through improvisation. Each gathering carries its own agenda and boundaries, even when it is improvisation. Except for those moments when we just hear music and instinctively accompany its rhythm. Each time, I feel the same uncomfortable feeling where everything I learned so far tells me to stop but I simply feel that I want to follow the rhythm. These learnings are deeply embodied, passed down from society: we learned that good girls don\u2019t dance in public, they jog for productivity, stretch for posture, and sway only when no one\u2019s watching; we learned how to act to be accepted. We\u2019ve been told to sit still, behave, and smile politely while the world burns out our nervous systems. Every moment I\u2019ve ignored my impulse to move has made me feel controlled. That same sense of control seeps into other parts of my life, unnoticed but persistent. Yet, every time I let go allowing movement to guide me, I feel both shame and unexpected relief. A release that remains, shaping the rest of my day, until I ignore it again. My auto-ethnographic exploration of movement in public spaces emerges from the tension between inner rhythm and societal tempo. I observe my body as both subject and tool\u2014understanding how motion regulates my stress, how visibility triggers shame, and how the act of moving publicly becomes an act of reclaiming presence. Public movement is only glorified when it\u2019s filmed and put on social media, movement becomes Instagrammable in the eyes of watchers. Public movement is an act of vulnerability, it\u2019s shameful, powerful, terrifying, uncomfortable, and necessary . In an environment that values speed and productivity over well-being, movement as reflection without purpose becomes rebellion . We feel caged because we live by rules that were taught, not chosen. I believe the body remembers what the mind forgets, and the body knows when the mind is lost in a 9 to 5 trance. I refuse to move only when the world allows it. I will dance because I feel like it and because I am tired of being still. I invite you to; slow down listen to your body notice the world around you notice the rhythm of your environment rather than the voices telling you to stop. dance like nobody\u2019s monetizing it. I invite you to feel uncomfortable, and ashamed. Use dance as a method, a meditation, and a manifesto. Each one of us is a dancer. There is no hierarchy of movement and nothing is unimportant.

These machines are designed to provoke critical thinking about technology and its relationship to society. The paradox lies in using seemingly unproductive creations as tools for exploring complex concepts like technological determinism and the impact of technology on human experience. Through the Machine Paradox, participants engage in hands-on, experimental learning that encourages a more critical and personal approach to technology.\u201d Hacking the Radio: From Utility to Uselessness \u00b6 We repurposed a Sunstech vintage radio, completely gutting its internal components and transforming the existing casing into the shell for our device. The opening where the original speaker once was now serves as the stage for our mechanical clown. Inside the box, three gears powered by an Arduino and controlled through a joystick, animate the clown\u2019s pop up experience. When the joystick is pushed upward, the system triggers the clown to spring through the speaker opening and deliver a prerecorded message revealing to all naive children that: \u201cSanta is not real\u201d. Instead of producing meaningful audio, the machine becomes performative, ironic, and self-referential. In order to achive this, we first tried to hacked two parts of the radio; the LCD and control module and the speaker. Hack #1: The LCD and Control Module \u00b6 One of the main components we wanted to work with was the control module. It was a circuit board in the front that held a microcontroller, an LCD module, buttons that were activated using silicon buttons with a conductive base, and a variety of smaller components to support these. The board had it\u2019s own microcontroller. On further inspection and research, the microcontroller had functions to control the entire device. It had inputs from the buttons and outputs to the components to allow for tuning through FM and AM Oscillators, memory storage and button control to access them (through the numpad), and other such features. We wanted to hack the chip to be able to access these controls but we were not sure of how to go about this. We attempted to transform part of the circuit board into capacitative touch sensors to build a digital controller. We repurposed the numpad buttons built-into the right side of the circuit board panel from the radio and connected it to the sensor pins of the Arduino. The original board had 6 buttons on the left that were designed to change radio settings when touched; and 9 buttons on the right in the form of a numpad that were controlling saved radio stations. To interface this with our computer, we soldered wires from the circuit-buttons on the radio\u2019s PCB to the numbered input pins on the Arduino. You can click here for the full hacking report. Hack #2: The Speaker \u00b6 When we opened up the radio, we found a passive speaker, and a PCB board. Our goal was to tap into the speaker system and create our own external amplifier, controlled by an Arduino. The internal speaker was a simple passive driver, meaning that we needed an amplifier unit. First, we tried to build our own amplifier with LM386 audio amplifier, IC Capacitors (10 \u00b5F, 100 \u00b5F, 0.1 \u00b5F), and a 10k potentiometer.

First, we tried to record a voice and store it with the original inputs of the radio. However, the memory capacity didn\u2019t store even 60KB data. In order to solve this, we decided to use a DFmini Player. The Killjoy \u00b6 We repurposed the speaker with our own audio using the amplifier of the main board from the radio. We reprogrammed the touch sensors from the original radio buttons to stimulate different sounds. Our main aim was to combine these two hacks to create our own useless mechanism. We used a Barduino, DFmini player, a speaker and a joystick. We recorded the audio to store inside the DF Player, and controlled the audio using joystick; when the joystick is used the next audio is played. For the mechanism of jack-in-the-box system, we tried different propotoypes first using cardboard, then we laser cut MDF pieces and 3D printed some parts to test the mechanism.

These machines are designed to provoke critical thinking about technology and its relationship to society. The paradox lies in using seemingly unproductive creations as tools for exploring complex concepts like technological determinism and the impact of technology on human experience. Through the Machine Paradox, participants engage in hands-on, experimental learning that encourages a more critical and personal approach to technology.\u201d","title":"The Machine Paradox"},{"location":"term1/04-unpacking-tech-systems/the-machine-paradox/#hacking-the-radio-from-utility-to-uselessness","text":"We repurposed a Sunstech vintage radio, completely gutting its internal components and transforming the existing casing into the shell for our device. The opening where the original speaker once was now serves as the stage for our mechanical clown. Inside the box, three gears powered by an Arduino and controlled through a joystick, animate the clown\u2019s pop up experience. When the joystick is pushed upward, the system triggers the clown to spring through the speaker opening and deliver a prerecorded message revealing to all naive children that: \u201cSanta is not real\u201d. Instead of producing meaningful audio, the machine becomes performative, ironic, and self-referential. In order to achive this, we first tried to hacked two parts of the radio; the LCD and control module and the speaker.","title":"Hacking the Radio: From Utility to Uselessness"},{"location":"term1/04-unpacking-tech-systems/the-machine-paradox/#hack-1-the-lcd-and-control-module","text":"One of the main components we wanted to work with was the control module. It was a circuit board in the front that held a microcontroller, an LCD module, buttons that were activated using silicon buttons with a conductive base, and a variety of smaller components to support these. The board had it\u2019s own microcontroller. On further inspection and research, the microcontroller had functions to control the entire device. It had inputs from the buttons and outputs to the components to allow for tuning through FM and AM Oscillators, memory storage and button control to access them (through the numpad), and other such features. We wanted to hack the chip to be able to access these controls but we were not sure of how to go about this. We attempted to transform part of the circuit board into capacitative touch sensors to build a digital controller. We repurposed the numpad buttons built-into the right side of the circuit board panel from the radio and connected it to the sensor pins of the Arduino.
